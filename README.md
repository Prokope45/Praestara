# Praestara
A Kansas State University neuroscience project involving a web application guiding study participants through their tasks to achieve their goals.

> **Notice**
>This project was cloned from and built using the official opensource [FastAPI Full-Stack Template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template) repo.

## Technology Stack and Features

    - 💃 Using TypeScript, hooks, Vite, and other parts of a modern frontend stack.
    - 🎨 [Material UI](https://mui.com) for the frontend components.
    - 🤖 An automatically generated frontend client.
    - 🧪 [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for End-to-End testing.
    - 🦇 Dark mode support.
- 🐋 [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com) for development and production.
- 🔒 Secure password hashing by default.
- 🔑 JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
- 📫 Email based password recovery.
- ✅ Tests with [Pytest](https://pytest.org).
- 📞 [Traefik](https://traefik.io) as a reverse proxy / load balancer.
- 🚢 Deployment instructions using Docker Compose, including how to set up a frontend Traefik proxy to handle automatic HTTPS certificates.
- 🏭 CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous deployment) based on GitHub Actions.

## First Local Setup

First run `./scripts/setup-env.sh`, which creates a copy of the `.env.example` as `.env` and automatically creates new keys for the secret and database password (must occur on fresh setup; if DB exists there will be password issues with `postgres` user, visit [DB documentation](scripts/README.md) for more info).

Then in `.env` set `FIRST_SUPERUSER` with your email and enter a password for `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`. Then run `docker compose build` to build the images, then `docker compose up -d db` to make sure the database container is running. Restore the database using the dump file: `./scripts/restore-db.sh <<PATH TO DB DUMP FILE>>` such as `./scripts/restore-db.sh data-dump.sql`.

Finally, run `docker compose watch` to run the rest of the containers and visit `localhost:5173` to see webapp.

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.
